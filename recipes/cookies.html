        <li>Egg and Yolks</li>
        <li>Granulated, Brown, and Powdered Sugar</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>BEAT:</strong> In a large bowl, beat the butter and sugars until light and creamy. Scrape the bowl
            and add the egg and yolks, one at a time, then the vanilla.</li>
        <li>WHISK: In a separate bowl, whisk the dry ingredients to distribute everything evenly. </li>
        <li>STIR: Gently stir the dry ingredients into the butter mixture by hand, then fold in the chocolate chips.
            Cover the bowl and chill the dough for at least 3 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>PREP: Preheat the oven to 350°F and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>SCOOP: Form the dough into 1 tablespoon-sized balls, arrange on the baking sheets, and optionally press a
            few chocolate chips into the tops.</li>
        <li>BAKE: Bake for 8-10 minutes until the edges are set. Cool on the baking sheets for 5-10 minutes before
            transferring to a wire rack.</li>
        <li>BEAT: In a large bowl, beat the butter, powdered sugar, salt, and vanilla until smooth. Add cream as needed
            until it’s thick enough to pipe.</li>
        <li>Gooey Chocolatey Goodness: Between the chocolate chips and fudgy texture, these brownie-like cookies are
            amazing all by themselves. But with the filling, they’re extra tasty!
